Now, let's start the mission.
Imagine you are sleeping in a lecture theatre during a boring lecture.                
Suddenly there is a fire in the room!

1. In the first mission, you will need to evacuate from the lecture theatre

Try to remember the lecture theatre map carefully. It will disappear when you start the game.
Once you start, you will be assigned with a random position. Type in the commands to move to the door and save yourself

2. Want to be a hero? Once you can get to the door safely, you can get the fire fighting equipment and go back to the fire position to extinguish it.

Remember to pickup an oxygen mask first, then a fire extinguisher. You will then need to get to the fire position and "spray" on the flame
